#### Music theory models in Go

There's an example command-line utility `music.go` to demo the libraries, with `bin/` wrappers for different functions, as follows.

##### Chords

To build a chord, run `bin/chord` followed by the name of the chord, e.g.:

    $ bin/chord Cm nondominant -5 679
    
    root: C
    tones:
      3: D#
      6: A
      7: A#
      9: D

To list the names of all the known chord-building rules, run `bin/chord ?`:

    $ bin/chord ?
    
    - Basic
    - Nondominant
    - Major Triad
    - Minor Triad
    - Augmented Triad
    - Diminished Triad
    - Suspended Triad
    - Omit Fifth
    - Flat Fifth
    - Add Sixth
    - Augmented Sixth
    - Omit Sixth
    - Add Seventh
    - Dominant Seventh
    - Major Seventh
    - Minor Seventh
    - Diminished Seventh
    - Half Diminished Seventh
    - Diminished Major Seventh
    - Augmented Major Seventh
    - Augmented Minor Seventh
    - Harmonic Seventh
    - Omit Seventh
    - Add Ninth
    - Dominant Ninth
    - Major Ninth
    - Minor Ninth
    - Sharp Ninth
    - Omit Ninth
    - Add Eleventh
    - Dominant Eleventh
    - Major Eleventh
    - Minor Eleventh
    - Omit Eleventh
    - Add Thirteenth
    - Dominant Thirteenth
    - Major Thirteenth
    - Minor Thirteenth

##### Scales

*coming soon!*

##### Keys
      
To build a key, use `bin/key` followed by the name of the key, e.g.:

    $ bin/key G#m
    root: G#
    mode: Minor

## Note

A Note is used to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound.

## Interval

An interval is the difference between two pitches.

## Key

The key of a piece is a group of pitches, or scale upon which a music composition is created in classical, Western art, and Western pop music.

## Chord

A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of three or more notes that is heard as if sounding simultaneously.
