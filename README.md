#### Opinionated models of the building blocks of music theory

There's an example command-line utility `music.go` to demo the libraries, with some helpful wrappers to run it from the command line.

To build a chord, use `bin/chord`:

    $ bin/chord Cm nondominant -5 679
    
This will output:
    
    root: C
    tones:
      3: D#
      6: A
      7: A#
      9: D
      
Use use `bin/key` to build a key:

    $ bin/key G#m
    root: G#
    mode: Minor

## Interval

An interval is the difference between two pitches.

## Key

The key of a piece is a group of pitches, or scale upon which a music composition is created in classical, Western art, and Western pop music.

## Chord

A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of three or more notes that is heard as if sounding simultaneously.
